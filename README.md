balena.io dependent device edge-node-manager written in Go.

## Getting started

- Sign up on [balena.io](https://dashboard.balena.io/signup)

You can deploy this project with one-click using the button below:

[![](https://balena.io/deploy.png)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/balena-io-playground/edge-node-manager)

Or, you can create an application in your balenaCloud dashboard and balena push this code to it the traditional way.

- Create a new application
- Set these variables in the `Fleet Configuration` application side tab
  - `RESIN_SUPERVISOR_DELTA=1`
  - `RESIN_UI_ENABLE_DEPENDENT_APPLICATIONS=1`
- Clone this repository to your local workspace
- Add the dependent application `resin remote` to your local workspace
- Provision a gateway device
- Push code to balena as normal :)
- Follow the readme of the [supported dependent
  device](#supported-dependent-devices) you would like to use

## API

The edge-node-manager provides an API that allows the user to set the
target status of the main process. This is useful to free up the on-board radios
allowing user code to interact directly with the dependent devices e.g. to
collect sensor data.

**Warning** - Do not try and interact with the on-board radios whilst the
edge-node-manager is running (this leads to inconsistent, unexpected behaviour).

### SET /v1/enm/status

Set the edge-node-manager process status.

#### Example

```
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT --data \
'{"targetStatus":"Paused"}' localhost:1337/v1/enm/status

curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT --data \
'{"targetStatus":"Running"}' localhost:1337/v1/enm/status
```

#### Response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

### GET /v1/enm/status

Get the edge-node-manager process status.

#### Example

```
curl -i -X GET localhost:1337/v1/enm/status
```

#### Response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    "currentStatus":"Running",
    "targetStatus":"Paused",
}
```

### GET /v1/devices

## Further reading

### About

The edge-node-manager is an example of a gateway
application designed to bridge the gap between Resin OS capable single board
computers (e.g. the Raspberry Pi) and non Resin OS capable devices (e.g.
micro-controllers). It has been designed to make it as easy as possible to add
new supported dependent device types and to run alongside your user application.

The following functionality is implemented:

- Dependent device detection
- Dependent device provisioning
- Dependent device restart
- Dependent device over-the-air (OTA) updating
- Dependent device logging and information updating
- API

### Definitions

#### Dependent application

A dependent application is a Resin application that targets devices not capable
of interacting directly with the Resin API.

The dependent application is scoped under a Resin application, which gets the
definition of gateway application.

A dependent application follows the same development cycle as a conventional
Resin application:

- It binds to your git workspace via the `resin remote`
- It consists of a Docker application
- It offers the same environment and configuration variables management

There are some key differences:

- It does not support Dockerfile templating
- The Dockerfile must target an x86 base image
- The actual firmware must be stored in the `/assets` folder within the built
  docker image

#### Dependent device

A dependent device is a device not capable of interacting directly with the
Resin API - the reasons can be several, the most common are:

- No direct Internet capabilities
- Not able to run the Resin OS (being a microcontroller, for example)

#### Gateway application

The gateway application is responsible for detecting, provisioning and managing
dependent devices belonging to one of its dependent applications. This is
possible leveraging a new set of endpoints exposed by the [Resin
Supervisor](https://github.com/resin-io/resin-supervisor).

The edge-node-manager (this repository) is an example of a gateway application.

#### Gateway device

The gateway device runs the gateway application and has the needed on-board
radios to communicate with the managed dependent devices, for example:

- Bluetooth
- WiFi
- LoRa
- ZigBee

Throughout development a Raspberry Pi 3 has been used as the gateway device.
